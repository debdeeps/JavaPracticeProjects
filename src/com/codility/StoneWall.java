/*VERY DIFFICULT
 You are going to build a stone wall. The wall should be straight and N meters long, and its thickness should be constant; however, it 
 should have different heights in different places. The height of the wall is specified by an array H of N positive integers. H[I] is the 
 height of the wall from I to I+1 meters to the right of its left end. In particular, H[0] is the height of the wall's left end and H[Nâˆ’1] 
 is the height of the wall's right end.

The wall should be built of cuboid stone blocks (that is, all sides of such blocks are rectangular). Your task is to compute the minimum 
number of blocks needed to build the wall.

Write a function:

class Solution { public int solution(int[] H); }

that, given an array H of N positive integers specifying the height of the wall, returns the minimum number of blocks needed to build it.

For example, given array H containing N = 9 integers:

  H[0] = 8    H[1] = 8    H[2] = 5
  H[3] = 7    H[4] = 9    H[5] = 8
  H[6] = 7    H[7] = 4    H[8] = 8
the function should return 7. The figure shows one possible arrangement of seven blocks.



Write an efficient algorithm for the following assumptions:

N is an integer within the range [1..100,000];
each element of array H is an integer within the range [1..1,000,000,000].

public class StoneWall {
	public static int solution(int[] H) {

		// main idea: need to use "stack" to check when we need a new block

		Stack<Integer> st = new Stack<>();
		int numBlock = 0;

		// note: H[i] is the ith height of the wall
		for (int i = 0; i < H.length; i++) {

			// step 1: "stack is not empty" AND "from high to low"
			// then, "pop" (it is the key point, be careful)
			System.out.println(st.isEmpty());
			while (st.isEmpty() == false && st.peek() > H[i]) {
				st.pop();
			}
			// step 2: if the stack is empty
			if (st.isEmpty()) {
				numBlock++; // add a block
				st.push(H[i]); // push the height
			}
			// step 3: the height is the same: do nothing
			else if (st.peek() == H[i]) {
			}
			// step 4: from low to high
			else if (st.peek() < H[i]) {
				numBlock++; // add a block
				st.push(H[i]); // push the height
			}
		}

		return numBlock;

		int[] A = { 8, 8, 5, 7, 9, 8, 7, 4, 8 };

		System.out.println(solution(A));
